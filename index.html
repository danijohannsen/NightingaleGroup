    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <h1>Nightingale is a lifestyle magazine and website targeted towards young women, with tastes
        for both the eclectic and traditional. It’s the home of things beautiful and cool, prim and wild at the same time. Located in San Jose, California, this mid-size media company has goals to reach a broader national and global audience with their digital content. The name “Nightingale” is inspired by the Keats poem, because beauty, both simple and dazzling, is an exceptional component of living well. Nightingale promotes meaningful consumption: fashion, furniture, and foods that will inspire, and enhance the real world experience.</h1>
    <p>"A thing of beauty is a joy forever" - John Keats</p>
